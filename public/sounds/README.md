# Sound Effects Setup

This directory should contain the following sound effect files:

- `load.mp3` - Bullet loading sound (plays when adding shells)
- `eject.mp3` - Shell ejection sound (plays when removing shells)
- `click.mp3` - Mechanical click sound (plays on hover)

## How to Add Sounds

1. Find or create appropriate industrial/mechanical sound effects
2. Save them as MP3 files in this directory
3. Uncomment the sound hooks in `src/components/ShellRating.tsx`
